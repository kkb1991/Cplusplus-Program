# Cplusplus-Program
Summary of project
ChadaTech has both domestic and international clients as is looking for a way for their clients to view 12- and a 24- hour clock on their website. The project I was tasked with is the creation of two clocks that will display simultaneously. To do this, I will apply C++ code to build an efficient and secure clock program that will allow user input for initial time as well as add hour(s), minute(s) and, second(s).  
What did you do particularly well?
My code in this project follows flowchart logic in relation to the format?s sequence of functions and effectively includes functions and the clock produces correct results.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
I could enhance my code by ensuring that not just the 12-hour format was shown but the 24-hour format was also displayed. I also could fix it so that when the user can add hour(s), minute(s), and second(s), it reached a capacity where it would reset; in my code, adding 1 to 59 should return to be 1:00.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am still very novice with coding so incorporating multiple files and ensuring the correct code implementation was where it needed to be was a little perplexing for me. I used online forums and youtube videos to help point me in the right direction when I was feeling utterly lost with why my files were not readable/extracting properly.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project was the tip of the iceberg for what I need practice with. It was a great introduction to incorporating languages into code, reading files, and just how essential organization and problem-solving (going through the code multiple times to fix highlighted errors).
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping it simple with clear and readable functions/variables/classes with in-line comments to provide context and explanation and proper whitespace so that the reader can easily interpret and enhance the code in the future.
